# Next Flight

This is a Svelte Kit project that finds the next 5 commercial flights out of your closest airport. This app uses SvelteKit, TailwindCSS, and takes advantage of the Weather.gov API and AerodataBox API.
## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```
